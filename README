							Hack Assembler

Introduction
------------
assembler.py converts a .asm file written in the Hack Machine language into a
.hack file that can be read by the Hack CPU emulator. It has been created as 
part of the Nand2Tetris online course, found at www.nand2tetris.org

Usage
-----
On the command line:- python3 assembler.py file.asm
Currently only one file can be converted at a time
There is only support for python3
A .hack file will be produced in the same directory as the .asm file
